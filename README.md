# Installation

This script is for Intel only! Not for use with AMD CPUs. All credits go to WCharacter; I simply make it work with up to date Linux kernels!

Don't forget to disable rdtscp in your qemu xml config like so:

<qemu:arg value="-cpu"/>

<qemu:arg value="host,rdtscp=off"/>

# Changing Timer

You can play with ticks if you want to:

* Open kernel-patch-6.8.0-65.patch in text editor
* Find handle_rdtsc function
* Change **u64 fake_diff =  diff / 16;**
* 16 is a divider of actual difference in timestamp, you can increase and decrease it

# Getting Started

Run the bash script and everything will be done for you:

* sudo bash kernel-patch-6.8.0-65.sh

# Applying ACS Override Patch

In the event you are trying to pass through devices like GPU, SSD, or USB controllers to your virtual machine AND your devices are in conflicting IOMMU groups, specify "y" when asked if you'd like to apply the ACS override patch. This patch forces the linux kernel to separate PCI devices into their own IOMMU groups. For more information, see https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Bypassing_the_IOMMU_groups_(ACS_override_patch).
WARNING: This patch is hit or miss, might work, might not! Additionally, applying this patch comes with some security risks, including but not limited to the guest potentially observing the host graphics card's framebuffer, monitoring the memory stack of your host network card, accessing memory of your sata controller, etc, who were both in the same real IOMMU group as the PCI device you've given to the guest.
